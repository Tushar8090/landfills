<h1>Landfills in HK</h1>
<p>There are only three landfills left in Hong Kong and people believe by 2020 the three landfills are going to be full and then they will have to build incinerators and burn all the waste then dump it in the ocean.

<h3> How is the HK government taking action?</h3>
 <p>The HK govnrement has taken action by the 50 cents action for a plastic bag. A good website over here to get more info.
<a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1752512/everything-you-need-know-about-hong-kongs-new-plastic-bag-levy">Click here for the website</a>
</br>The bags that you should use is paper bags because they don't break very easily and you can reuse them a lot. The plastic bags for 50 cents is soppuse to make people think about how much waste is going into the landfills and they should not waste things.
<h3>How does HK waste levels measure against the rest of the world?</h3>
<p>Countries like japan have their waste levels going down a lot but in Hong Kong the waste levels went up a lot over the last ten years but now the waste levels  are going down. If we are comparing Hong Kong from the rest of the world then Hong Kong is going to have one of the worst waste levels. In metro tokyo you will see 0.77 kg of waste in someone's rubbish bin. In Seoul city you will see 0.95 kg of weight in someones rubbish bin. In Taipei city you will see 1 kg of weight in someone's rubbigh bin and in Hong Kong you will see 1.36 kg of weight in someone's rubbish bin. So from that you can see that Hong Kong is going very bad against other countries because Hong Kong's waste levels are going very high.<p>
<h3>How much food waste goes into the landfills every day?</h3>
<p>More then 3200 tons of food waste goes into  the landfills everyday and the weight of that much is about 1,103 elephants. The fod waste levels in Hong Kong is going very high and to stop this you have to save your things for afterwards or just donate your food to poor people. In the world there are a lot of poor people oso if you go any where arond the world remember to donate your food.</p>
<h3>Targets</h3>
<p>HK wants hygienic landfills so the people who live near the landfill don't get sick/ill and also to recycle more and to do that Hong Kong needs to have more recycling bins so more people will recycle.There are still a few charities out there which still recycle things and try to stop food waste but don't just leave all the work all to them you have to do something. Below is a video about waste.</p>
